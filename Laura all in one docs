Laura can be made with either a Straight or a Curved Waistband.

Laura can be drafted with diffrent rises using the option Waistband Height. When the option Waistband is true, the Waistband Width is considered in the rise.

Laura can be made with a gusset for more range of movement but is entirely optional and does not change the draft of the legs so can be added even if already constructed.

### Main Fabric

Laura is drafted with stretch fabric such as **Lycra** and **Spandex** in mind. But by decreasing the negative ease you may also be able to use other **Knit Fabrics** with less stretch. 
The fabric you use will at least need to be two-way stretch but can be four-way stretch.

title: "Laura: What You Need"
---

To make Laura, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.25 - 1.5 metres of a suitable fabric ([see Laura Fabric options](/docs/patterns/laura/fabric/))
- (Optional) Elastic slightly longer than your waist/hips measure and half the width of the waistband.

<Note>

Elastic can be used with any waistband options but is only really needed for 'none' so is set a optional.

<Warning>

USE STRETCH STITCHES! This pattern is made with negative eases and will require stretch stitches to allow the pieces to stretch enough to fit the body. This is why the topstitching is labeled as optional as it may restrict stretch.

</Warning>

<Tip>

If you have and overlocker/serger you may wish to use this to sew all of your seams.

A twin needle may also be used and will save time on having to finsih the seams.

Make sure the needles you are using are either stretch or ballpoints so they do not poke holes in the fabric whilst sewing.

</Tip>

### Step 1: Sew the inseam.

- With *good sides together* sew the inseam together on one of the leg pieces.
- *Finsih* seams.
- (Optional) _Edgestitch_ or _Topstitch_ the seam allowance down.
- Repeat Step 1 for the other leg.  

### Step 2: The gusset.

If you are not using the gusset you can skip this step.  

- With *wrong sides together* _Baste_ the two gusset pieces together. These will now be treated as one piece.
- With *good sides together* sew the gusset to one leg matching the notch on the gusset to the inseam on the leg.
- (Optional) _Edgestitch_ or _Topstitch_ the seam allowance down.

Now follow the crotch instructions making sure the inseam of the other leg lines up with the other notch on the gusset.

### Step 3: The crotch.

- With *good sides together* insert one of the legs into the other matching inseams. Pin in place.
- Sew the crotch seam.
- Turn good sides out.
- (Optional) _Edgestitch_ or _Topstitch_ the seam allowance down.

### Step 4: The waist

#### Waistband Straight

- With *good sides together* sew the waistband together along the short ends.
- Press the seam open.
- With *wrong sides together* press the waistband in half lengthwise.
- With *good sides together* sew the waistband to the legs matching notches and the seam of the waistband to the centre back seam of the legs.
- *Finish* seam.
- Press waistband up away from the legs, pressing the seam allowance down.
- (Optional) _Edgestitch_ or _Topstitch_ the waistband, you can either sew on either side of the seam or *stitch in the ditch*.

#### Waistband Curved


#### No Waistband


### Step 5: Hemmings

- Press up the hem allowances of the legs to the *wrong side*
- On the *good side* *Topstitch* the hem in place close to the raw edge that is on the inside.
- (Optional) *Topstitch* again an 1/8" - 1/4" (3mm -6mm) away from the first stitching catching the hem allowance underneath.

<Note>

The stitch you use when hemming needs to allow the fabric to stretch as much as possible as the hem will need to be able to stretch over the heel.

</Note>

### Step 6: Enjoy!

You're all done now go show off your new leggings!
